## What do I like to give talks on?
I enjoy speaking at technical conferences in different cities. Almost all my talks are related to software engineering as a craft, Python, and web application topics. If you would like me to speak at your next conference, send me an email me at <susan.tan.fleckerl@gmail.com>.

I've been volunteering on the PyCon talks committee since 2015, helping to vote on hundreds of PyCon talk proposals.
