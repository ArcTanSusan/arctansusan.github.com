Brief Thoughts on Work Culture at Tech Companies
================================================

I've been thinking recently about what makes "good" work culture in a tech-focused workplace. I won't begin with boring or pedantic definitons of what a "good" work culture is. Certainly, we can all agree that good work culture goes beyond material benefits in the office (ie: free food and beer and company swag). Good work culture fosters an intangibly collaborative atmosphere where co-workers are learning from each other.

When most of these indicators can be found in your workplace and you feel happy to be see your co-workers the next day, you know you're in "good" work culture. This is a brief summary of some aspects of a good work culture.

You know you are in a good work culture if you
1. have friends and people you can trust in the workplace. You feel comfortable asking them technical questions or can hold technical conversations with them in meetings or in code pairing sessions. You also feel comfortable talking about non-technical topics. too. You're free to be yourself and don't feel a need to conform to an existing culture.
2. you have people who code review your work and you review other people's code. Having a good code review culture is essential to a good work culture in a tech company. Good code review practices have been covered in research studies such as that done by [IBM](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/11-proven-practices-for-peer-review/). A great deal of my learning and growth has come from seeing different view points in my code review feedback. Code review brings a fresh perspective on my work and opens my mind to different and often more elegant solutions to the technical problem I want to solve. I like to review other people's pull requests, even pointing out typos, to get a better idea of what projects that my co-workers are working on.
3. have executives who are open to feedback and refining the development process. There isn't a one-size-fits-all developing and release process that works for all tech companies. Maybe the idea of having a single deadline for all projects isn't working out? Or, the idea of having 2-week sprints isn't compatible with long R&D-type projects? Executives that can revise and fine-tune the team's project mangement and release process based on the feedback of engineers and tech managers will have a good understanding of how long projects take.
