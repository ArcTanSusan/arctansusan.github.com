The Year 2014 in Review: What did Susan Tan do?
=====================================================


* Attended [Open Source Bridge 2014](http://opensourcebridge.org/y2014/) and [Ada Camp 2014](http://portland.adacamp.org/) in Portand as well as the first [Django Bar Camp](https://engineering.eventbrite.com/announcing-barcamp-django-sf/) at Eventbrite HQ, San Francisco.

* Gave a full-length talk as a first-time speaker at PyCon 2014 in Montreal, where I traveled outside the U.S.A for the first time in 15 years.

* Attended YaoiCon for my first time, one of the most well-organized inclusive animecons that exist, and it was there that I started reading my first yaoi manga: **About Love** illustrated by Tomo Ootake and written by Narise Konohara.

* Learned how to properly cut onions as cooking preparation for the first time.

* Left a job coding in a boring language called Java, because I was in love with Python. For the first time in forever, I work with an incredible team of world-class (also, impeccably dressed) Python engineers at [Piston](pistoncloud.com/company/careers/).

* Volunteered on the PyCon 2015 Talks Commmitee to vote on the best talk proposals (out of a record-breaking stack of 650+ submitted talk proposals) to appear on the final talk schedule of [PyCon 2015](https://us.pycon.org/2015/schedule/talks/list/).

* Continued with adult ballet classes for the 5th year in a row. I have finally discovered the most inspirational ballet instructor in the entire city of SF. I have since attended almost all her classes.

* Continued contributing to my favorite Python open source projects, including [OpenHatch](http://openhatch.org/).

* Organized a number of full-day code sprints for the OpenHatch community.

* Started a tea blog that focuses on oolong, green, and white teas.

* Expanded and diversified my personal tea collection from the two most well-known tea stores in SF.

* Met new software engineering friends who are not alumni of the same college I've attended.

* Observed cats napping at a [cat cafe](http://www.yelp.com/biz/cat-town-caf%C3%A9-oakland) in Oakland, one of the first of its kind in the U.S.

* Discovered new rising star female novelists in the fantasy genre who wrote the following new series: **Queen of the Tearling**, **Shadow and Bone**, **The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in A Ship Of Her Own Making**, **The Girl Who Never Was**. One of these novels will soon be made into a major adventure-action movie that stars Emma Watson as the protagonist queen.

* Realized that almost every book I've read this year was written by a woman.

* Discovered Radio Lab podcasts.

* Went to a well-designed special exhibit at the Walt Disney Family Museum and was enchanted by a beautiful and influential long dead artist [Mary Blair](http://www.waltdisney.org/mary-blair).

* Watched every major movie that stars [Audrey Hepburn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn).

* Traveled all the way by BART to visit far-away places including Berkeley, Pleasanton, Fremont, and Oakland for the first time in my life.

* Began a quest to have tea at every tea house in San Francisco.

* Tasted pu-er tea for the first time at my favorite-but-now-closed [tea house](http://www.yelp.com/biz/taste-san-francisco-2) in Hayes Valley.

* Discovered my favorite UK-based elite-luxury [clothing brand](http://www.alexandermcqueen.com/us/alexandermcqueen/women/subhome_woman), which happens to have a fabulous store just 1 block away from where the work office of Piston is located.
