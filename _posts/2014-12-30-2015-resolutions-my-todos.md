The year 2014 is almost over. It's been a very fun and exciting year.

In no particular order, here is a list of my lofty resolutions for the upcoming year. It's basically a TODO list of new activities that I'm looking forward to try and some old activities I should continue doing --

* Explore `strace` for Linux OS to spy on my programs, especially after watching Julia Evans' very engaging [lightning talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pEHfGKB-OE) and hearing good things about her well-written beginner-friendly [blog](http://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/18/you-can-be-a-kernel-hacker/) [posts](https://gist.github.com/jvns/58cbd798a481a3f703fd).

* Find a candy store in San Francisco that has yummy candies from the U.K.

* Attempt to never leave the 47-square mile city of San Francisco unless by a commercial airplane, because I dislike traveling to new places so much.

* Continue to dine at least once in *every* Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Malaysian restaurant in the city of San Francisco.

* Continue to read exclusively books published after the year 2000.

* Continue to discover new rising star female novelists who write in the fantasy and sci fi genres.

* Read *every* fantasy/sci-fi comic book written after the year 2000 that features a main female protagonist.

* Maintain an active tea-focused blog about Chinese and Taiwanese-imported tea.

* Maintain an active general blog (this one!) filled with random observations about life and brief technical notes.

* Learn about potential security problems with Python package managers such as pip and PyPI.

* Upload my own `ArcTanSusans-malicious-package` onto PyPI the Python package manager and observe how many people will `pip install` it.

* Attend an International-style-only ballroom dance party in the Bay Area, ideally in San Francisco (so that I don't break the 3rd TODO item).

* Attend at least 3 full-length story-based classical ballet performances in the Spring 2015 Season to be performed by SF Ballet and write reviews for all of them.

* Continue intermittently tweeting my profound dislike of SFMuni buses, Caltrains, and generally all public transportation in the Bay Area.
