A Brief Review of The Christmas Ballet
=====================================================

On Thursday, December 18, I attended The Christmas Ballet from the Smuin Ballet Company. This is a very brief review and some lasting impressions. This review would probably make no sense if you haven't already seen the show.

Act I was nicely done with lots of solos, formations of up to 6 dancers, and various pas de deux dances. Each ballet performance was choreographed specifically for a different Christmas song. All the dancing was so well executed. I especially like Erin Yarbrough's soloist performance to the song "Ave Maria". I was not impressed espescially with the small formations, however, and there were number of fun choreography such as in "Veni, Veni Emmanuel". Large formations have a much more dramatic effect and you can appreciate the preicse and detailed synchrony of everyone doing the same choreography. I personally like the larger formations, as they are more techniclly difficult to choreograph and execute.

I found Act II takes a completley different artistic direction; Act II featured other types of dances, includig ballroom and tap dancing. That was unexpected surprising. I suppose I am not used to seeing non-ballet dance scenes (tap dancing? a ballroom swing dance?) and its abundat use of theatrical gimmicks. After all, what sort of art critic would I be if I can't tell the difference between classical ballet and a ballet-inspired ballroom dance piece?  The Smuin Company, founded recently in 1994, does not produce purely classical ballet performances. As entertaining as Act II was, I did not appreciate the large amounts of gimmicks as the central piece in the performances. In fact, gimmicks distracted from the dancing. However there are some nice standouts in Act II, including the performance to the song "Santa Baby", which includes a lot of props and background dancers. I also like the interpretation of the Grinch in "Mean and Green". If you're a fan of pure classical ballet and study ballet, you'd probably be disappointed in Act II as most of the acts are not ballet. In fact, I activley dislike some of the songs chosen such as "Baby It's Cold Outside" for its disturbingly rapey themes.

I do recommend this ballet for those who are into classical ballet and those new to dance performances. I also suggest walking out at the end of Act I.
