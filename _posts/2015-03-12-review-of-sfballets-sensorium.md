A Ballet Review of SF Ballet's "Sensorium"
=====================================================

On Tuesday evening on March 10th, I entered the grand lobby of the Memorial Opera House about 40 minutes before the start of the performance. Immediately, I noticed that almost everyone was surprisingly under 30. In the world of live classical art performances where most of the 
demographics of the audience can recall glorious historical figures such as Coco "Gabrielle" Chanel when they were still alive, it was an atypical shock for me to see younger people about my age at a ballet performance.

The three performances of William Forsythe’s “The Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude”, Christopher Wheeldon’s “Borealis” and Liam Scarlett’s “Hummingbird", made by three different modern-day choreographers and with live music from the reknown SF Ballet Orchestra (SFBO), were all technically impressive. I have brief observations.The music of "The Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude” is very fast and the equally fast choreography is hyperactively attention-grabbing. Doing a petit allegro is hard in class. Doing a very fast petit allegros is a lot harder. Throughout the piece, there is no time at all for dancers to catch their breath, they have to **move**very quickly, and if you blink, you'll miss a moment. However, the dancers didn't make the piece feel rushed, every step was well defined that I can see a beginning and an end to each movement.

Clean lines and execution, perfect lift and body alignment, high leg extensions -- these are all the basic physical elements that any audience would expect of a professional ballet dancer in any ballet company.


Given the massive demgraphics of people who are younger than 35, the #HopeCadenza hashtag became popular for a new minutes on Twitter. This sounds gimmicky, but is effective to get more folks who happen to be on Twitter intersted in ballet.
