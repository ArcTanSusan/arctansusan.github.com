Dear Readers,

As you know, I left my former Java web engineer job at Flixster & Rotten Tomatoes on April 7, 2014 in pursuit of a job in the language that I’m in love with — **Python**.


Today I’m happy to announce that I’m joining the backend engineering team at [**Piston Cloud**](http://www.pistoncloud.com/press-releases/piston-named-one-of-the-top-10-best-places-to-work-in-the-san-francisco-bay-area/) in San Francisco. I’ll be working on a private cloud-compute system built underneath Open Stack. This technology is pushing the boundaries of what is possible with distributed systems engineering and scalable VMs. The backend system is 100% in Python, of course. I will be a Django backend engineer, a distributed systems engineer, and a front-end Javascript engineer. I’ll start off in the first role as a backend engineer, working on the Django web application, and eventually in the long-term, I will occupy all three roles and wear many fancy hats. Exciting! I’ll learn a ton in the process. Occasionally, I’m expected to contribute back to Open Stack, so there will be even more Python open source in my life.


I’m joining an engineering team of less than 25 engineers at this early-stage cloudy startup. Accumulatively, this team has a grant total of 200 years of experience in software engineering, architecture, management, and cloud computing systems. In fact, the co-founders and senior management of this company are the original early engineers of Open Stack itself back when it was an experimental research project that grew from R+D at NASA. A number of the engineering managers also happen to be PSF board members.


I really love this team's culture. The employees literally do wear fancy hats at work. They show up at the Open Stack Global Summit in formal three-piece suits and cocktail dresses. They go to tea parties, tea tastings, and wine tastings together. Perfect culture fit.

From,


Susan Tan
