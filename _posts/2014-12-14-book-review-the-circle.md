First Impressions on The Beginning of Dave Egger's novel *The Circle*
=====================================================

***Note***: There will be spoilers for the first quarter of the novel.

I've started reading *The Circle*, a well-deserved international bestseller about an employee named Mae who works at a large technology company in the Bay Area. She lives in a "utopian" campus life, where there's free food, on-site gardens, on-site libraries, on-site grocery stores, and bus shuttles that take workers throughout the Bay Area to and from the work campus. This is a generic familiar setting to tech workers in the Bay Area. WIthin the first ten pages, I'm already impressed wth the author's clean and efficient writing style in his story-telling, narration, and outright parody of the modern day tech culture in the Bay Area. *1984*-like global surveillance, wrapped in the guise of tech culture and innovation, is a big theme in this chillng parable.

Tech culture is lampooned at each and every turn. Mae works in a building that consists of laser-cut red stones that spell out words such as "Dream", "Participate", "Innovate", "Imagine". Surely this is a reminder of well-known [mottos](http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/facebook-philosophy-move-fast-and-break-things) at a very familiar tech company. Mae is a new employee who is proud to work at TrueYou, a company that invented a single sign-in identity managemt system called the *Unified Operating System*. Such a system combines everyone's "social media profile, their payment systems, their various passwords, their email accounts, user names, perferences, every last tool and manifestation of their interets", removing the need for anyone to ever remember passwords or have multiple online profiles. TrueYu, within just four years, grew into a global force that "subsumed Facebook, Twitter, Google, and finally Alacrity, Zoopa, Jefe, and Quan" (p23). This is truly chilling. Yet, Mae, being naive and uncritical of the impact of these technologies and being representative of the majority of the employees there, sees nothing of these privacy concerns. In one remarkable scene, the company executives make a public announcement to employees that they've invented and then deployed tiny cameras that can capture every moment in any time in any place across every corner of the globe. You can see moments of every revolution in any place in the world. You can monitor your elderly parents. And no one would ever know they're being monitored. Thunderous outstanding applause greets this public announcement. Throughout this scene, I was thinking, "How can these employees NOT see what's really going on with the full terror of these privacy violations? Why is no one at this company speaking out against this?" Egger's writing creates a tension of dramtic irony between the contrasting responses of the readers and response of the characters in the story. Within the first 40 pages, I get a very clear sense of the setting, the culture, the company that which Mae so proudly and unquestionably serves.

There are moments of hilarity that most readers who are working in tech will appreciate. Mae logs into the social feed at her company and finds a torrent of messages in the messaging channels. An assigned social media assistant who sets this up for her points out that she has a lot of in-company social media to catch up, including up to 8,276 messages from the last week only. This social network at the company is extravagant -- there are hundreds of social groups for every interest. The amount and specificity is hilariously exagerrated. At TrueYu, there are, for example, hundreds of parents' groups from "first first-time parents, divorced parents, parents of autistic children, parents of Guatemalan adoptees, Ethopian adoptees, Russian adoptees. There are seven improv comedy groups, nine swim teams..." (p103). Personaly, I know how it's easy to see a flood of IRC messages on all the channels when I return at my work desk every morning. Various IRC channels, Slack channels, and maling lists are the typical communications of most well-develped tech companies.

The set up is well-done and lots of familiar tech culture elements are here for those with an eye for detail. I'll keep posting on my thoughts on the rest of the novel.
